    <p> The word of God was believed to have framed the world as we know it </p>
    <p> The will of God is Gods instructions to us men desiring our compliance for our own good </p>
    <p> With man's fall not all men know God's will and because man was made for God's purposes,the
        lost and wondering man began to search for his original purpose. This quest caused man untold suffering as 
        he wondered farther from God and began to worship created things like wood and stone,God in his infinite mercy 
        Provided a way of turning man back to himself which is what man was created for to serve his maker.</p>
